# 🧠 Backend Engineer Core

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

**Backend Engineer Core** is a repository designed to help me **develop core skills in backend engineering**.  
This repo goes beyond writing simple CRUD operations, focusing on **building real-world, scalable, secure, and high-performance backend systems**.

Each week, I focus on a different topic:
- Research the concept,  
- Implement minimal example code,  
- Document practical use cases and industry best practices.

---

## 🎯 Goals

This repository aims to:
- Teach the **fundamental building blocks of backend systems**  
- Enable designing **scalable, secure, and high-performance services**  
- Cover **end-to-end backend engineering processes**  
- Explore **industry best practices in real-world backend systems**  
- Build a **portfolio-quality knowledge base** for backend engineering

---

### Contents of Each Week

- **README.md** → Notes, theory, usage examples, and insights for the week  
- **src/** → Minimal and practical example code demonstrating the topic

2. **Async & Threading** – Multi-tasking and non-blocking operations  
3. **Cache / Redis** – Fast data access and load reduction  
4. **Load / Stress Testing** – Measuring system performance  
5. **Rate Limiting / Throttling** – API protection and security  
6. **Message Queue / Asynchronous Processing** – Asynchronous data flow  
7. **Database Optimization** – Indexing, query optimization, transaction management  
8. **Backend Security** – Authentication, Authorization, Input validation  
9. **Microservices & Event-driven Architecture** – Modular and scalable system design  
10. **Observability / Monitoring** – Metrics, logs, tracing  
11. **Stress / Chaos Testing** – Resilience and fault-tolerance testing  
12. **Deployment & DevOps** – Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, production deployment

## 🗓️ Weekly Workflow

1. **Research** → Study the topic, take notes  
2. **Implement** → Create a minimal example in `src/`  
3. **Document** → Write what was learned, industry applications, and challenges in `README.md`  

---

## 💻 Usage

- Each folder can be explored and run independently  
- Code examples are **minimal** and focus on demonstrating the concept  
- `README.md` files contain **theory, advantages, and real-world applications**  

---

## 🧭 Future Extensions

- Event-driven microservices with Kafka or RabbitMQ  
- Spring Cloud and advanced service orchestration  
- Kubernetes deployment scenarios  
- Advanced system design examples
